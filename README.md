# Library-Book-Return-Counter-using-Stack
This project simulates a library book return system using a stack, where books are processed in Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) order. Returned books are pushed onto the stack and removed using pop operations. The system helps track returns efficiently, manage book order, and demonstrate stack operations in a real-world scenario.
